            I'm Juan David Álvarez Sarmiento and I'm a <strong>frontend developer</strong> with one year of experience based in Bogotá. I'm passionate about web and data technologies, specially, in the integration of UX, UI, with software engineering. <br/>
            </p>
            <p>
            I enjoy a lot listening to people's needs and what they expect about their products, that's why in every project I like to be involved in the gathering of requirements to transform all those ideas into code and deploy them with continuous integration and improvement. <br/>
            </p>
            <p>
            Throughout my life I've developed skills to work with diverse teams, adapt fast to circumstances, and communicate ideas assertively. I use <strong>HTML, CSS, SCSS, JS (with React), Bootstrap, Firebase, SQL and Git</strong>  to pull off project's goals. I'm on the road of learning Angular, Vue and NodeJS in the next months along with Platzi. <br/>  
            </p>
            <p>
            In my free time I love reading and writing about the future of the relationship between the human species and software technologies in domains such as ethics and economics. I write right <a href="">here</a> about that. <br/>
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Curious Facts:</strong>  I speak Spanish, English and French, I have a background on Environmental Sciences and I often paint landscapes with watercolor.
